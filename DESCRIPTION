Title: Environmental Risk Score
Type: Package
Description: Estimate environmental risk scores from a number of potentially 
    correlated risk factors using adaptive elastic net (AENET) regression. ENET 
    regression does variable 
    selection and can select multiple non-zero collinear variables without 
    overfitting. AENET is an adaptive version of elastic net (ENET) that satisfies
    the asymptotic normality assumption that allows us to conduct statistical 
    inference any hypothesis testing by providing large sample standard errors 
    and p-values. Adaptive weights shink smaller coefficients to zero, whereas
    larger coefficients are penalized less. The technical details of the model 
    implemented here are described in "Associations of cumulative exposure to 
    heavy metal mixtures with obesity and its comorbidities among U.S. adults in 
    NHANES 2003â€“2014" (2018) In press at Environment International
